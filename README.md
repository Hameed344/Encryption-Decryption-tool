# Encryption-Decryption-tool
Encryption and decryption play critical roles in various fields, including information security, communication, data protection, and privacy.
Encryption is the process of converting plain, readable data (referred to as plaintext) into an unreadable format (referred to as ciphertext). The primary purpose of encryption is to ensure confidentiality by protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access or interception.
Decryption, on the other hand, is the reverse process of encryption. It involves converting ciphertext back into its original plaintext.
